# StoryboardVideoPlayer
This is a simple video player using UIKit and the storyboard interface.

Note that in the case of storyboards, you must overide viewDidAppear.  This is where you present the AVPlayerViewController.

Because Apple has created an AVPlayerViewController, it is quite easy to imbed a video player.

I have intentionally kept this simple and the bare minimum of what is required
